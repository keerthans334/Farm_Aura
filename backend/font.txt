Plan for Pest Detection Feature Implementation:

Create PestDetection Page:
UI sections:
Header ("Pest & Disease Detection")
Upload Crop Image (icon, instructions, "Take Photo" and "Upload File" buttons)
Recent Scans (list of scan cards: pest name, recommendation, time, severity, confidence, actions)
Photography Tips (Best Practices and Avoid These, styled as in screenshot)
Sidebar Navigation:
Add "Pest Detection" to sidebar with icon, route /pest-detection, and active state styling.
Routing:
Add route in App.js for /pest-detection to render the new page.
Styling:
Use existing color palette and card/button styles for consistency.
Add new CSS if needed for Pest Detection-specific UI elements.
